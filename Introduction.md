# Predicting-Bulk-Density-with-Machine-Learning
### What is Density logging?
Density logging is a well logging tool that can provide a continuous record of a formation's bulk density along the length of a borehole. In geology, bulk density is a function of the density of the minerals forming a rock (i.e. matrix) and the fluid enclosed in the pore spaces. This is one of three well logging tools that are commonly used to calculate porosity.

### How Density log values are obtained
The tool was initially developed in the 1950s and became widely utilized across the hydrocarbon industry by the 1960s. A type of active nuclear tool, a radioactive source and detector are lowered down the borehole and the source emits medium-energy gamma rays into the formation. Radioactive sources are typically a directional Cs-137 source. These gamma rays interact with electrons in the formation and are scattered in an interaction known as Compton scattering. The number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detector, placed at a set distance from the emitter, is related to the formation's electron density,[1] which itself is related to the formation's bulk density.

###Introducing Machine Learning Algorithms
Conventional well logging tools can lead to missing sections. Machine learning algorithms can cut short the time and cost of running a wireline to obtain the missing section values by using trained algorithms to predict those missing sections.
